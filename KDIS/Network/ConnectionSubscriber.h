    class:      ConnectionSubscriber
    created:    19/10/2010
    author:     Karl Jones

    purpose:    This class allows you to handle PDU in an event based manner.
                It also allows for an IP address filter mechanisms to be created.
                Note: Any PDU filtering should be done in the PDU_Factory.

                An example of some of the uses of the ConnectionSubscriber could be:
                    Statistics
                    EntityManager
                    IpAddressFilter
                    Logging

    // FullName:    KDIS::NETWORK::ConnectionSubscriber::OnDataReceived
    // Description: This function is first called when data is received on the connection,
    //              before any decoding has been performed.
    //              You should return true if you wish the connection to continue processing
    //              the data(i.e decode the PDU) or false if you want it to stop and discard the data.
    //              This means you can create a filter mechanism here for IP address.
    // Parameter:   const KOCTET * Data
    // Parameter:   KUINT32 DataLength
    // Parameter:   const KString & SenderIp

    // FullName:    KDIS::NETWORK::ConnectionSubscriber::OnPDUReceived
    // Description: Called after a PDU has been decoded (GetNextPDU). Use this function to handle various PDU,
    //              e.g a data logger or entity manager class.
    //              Note: This function is not for filtering, for PDU based filtering see the PDU_Factory.
    //              Note: By default this PDU will be deleted unless it is released(unique_ptr) by the function that calls GetNextPDU.
