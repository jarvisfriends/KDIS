    class:      TimeStamp
    created:    16/10/2008
    author:     Karl Jones

    purpose:    Stores absolute/ relative timestamps.
                Timestamps are used to reduce the error in a simulation.

                A lot of DIS simulators simply ignore timestamps however if error(I.E inaccuracy
                between a entities position and its actual position) is an issue then the timestamp
                can be used to reduce this error.

                Absolute timestamps tend to require the use of very accurate and expesnive clocks which are synchronized.
                Relative timestamps are less accurate and tend to use the computers internal clock.

                The following is taken straight from the DIS standard:
                "To make sure that relative timestamps are synchronized, you need to compare information about a received
                PDU that contains a relative timestamp with the time you are maintaining in your simulation application.
                This is done using software and without any special hardware. It does require that a few packets be observed
                before time is well synchronized. As packets are received, the difference between their relative timestamps
                and the receiver's clock is averaged. This average will correspond to the average latency, and the difference
                represents clock skew. After a few dozen packets, the difference between the observed average and the real
                average latency is around 5ms. After several hundred, the difference is in the 1ms neighborhood. This is not
                as long a time to wait as might be imagined. A dozen ES PDU's per minute are emitted by simulators for
                entities which are stopped. Thus, a few minutes of idle time before the exercise starts provides data for 5ms
                accuracy, and at 1-2 PDU's per second while moving, 1ms accuracy can be had in a matter of minutes.
                Exercises with stricter needs really should use absolute based time."
