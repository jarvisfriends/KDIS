This example shows how to use the PDU bundling features in KDIS.
If you are sending multiple PDU in a short time then bundling
them into a single datagram can help reduce bandwidth and increase performance.
Note: Not all systems support bundling.

Run the PDU_Factory2 example to see the output of this example, PDU_Factory1 does not support bundling.
